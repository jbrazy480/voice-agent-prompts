# RizzDial + Beam: the recommended path

RizzDial is a commercial platform for AI voice agents and AI calling, with MCP for Claude and Codex. Beam provides texting from an iMessage business line. These are separate services; this repository does not connect to them automatically.

## RizzDial for calls

1. [Create a RizzDial account](https://app.rizzdial.com/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=voice-agent-prompts&utm_content=rizzdial-signup) and pick a plan on the signup page, or [book a call](https://rizzdial.com/booked?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=voice-agent-prompts&utm_content=done-for-you) to have the team set it up.
2. Sign in to the RizzDial dashboard and open **Connect MCP**. The [public MCP guide](https://rizzdial.com/mcp?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=voice-agent-prompts&utm_content=rizzdial-mcp) explains the connection. Pick the Claude or Codex tab and click **Copy** for your account's exact MCP URL. Do not guess that URL.
3. Run the copied command locally and authorize in your browser:
   - Claude Code: `claude mcp add --transport http rizzdial YOUR_RIZZDIAL_MCP_URL`, then `claude mcp login rizzdial`.
   - Codex: `codex mcp add rizzdial --url YOUR_RIZZDIAL_MCP_URL`. Authorization opens on first use; `codex mcp login rizzdial` triggers it explicitly.
   - For a no-terminal option, the RizzDial MCP page can open claude.ai's **add custom connector** screen with the URL prefilled; confirm and approve.
4. Verify with `claude mcp list` / `claude mcp get rizzdial`, or `codex mcp list`. Ask "List my AI agents" and check that the names are yours.

MCP access is for RizzDial customers. If Connect MCP is missing, [book a call](https://rizzdial.com/booked?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=voice-agent-prompts&utm_content=done-for-you). RizzDial's public MCP guide does not document ChatGPT setup; ChatGPT users should [book a call](https://rizzdial.com/booked?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=voice-agent-prompts&utm_content=done-for-you).

Once connected, documented requests include:

- "List my AI agents."
- "Create a new outbound agent for lead follow-up."
- "Which phone numbers are available?"
- "Search for numbers in the 312 area code."
- "Which of my agents have no number assigned?"
- "Show recent call history."
- "What is the status of my running campaigns?"
- "Pause the voice campaign called X."

The connection acts as you and can change or delete things. Review the proposed action and confirm before deleting anything, bulk contact edits, buying numbers, or starting a live campaign. For importing a script, assigning a number, or arranging a test call, [book a call](https://rizzdial.com/booked?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=voice-agent-prompts&utm_content=done-for-you); those steps are not specified in the verified setup instructions.

## Beam for texting

1. [Text our team to try it](https://beamtexting.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=voice-agent-prompts&utm_content=beam). The form is on the Beam homepage. Create a workspace with your work email and business name. It opens a private preview with sample data; nothing sends.
2. Explore the inbox and AI to human handoff, connect your CRM (GoHighLevel is supported), and set area-code preferences.
3. Choose a plan in **Billing**. A dedicated line is assigned before live sending unlocks.
4. For MCP with Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor, sign in as workspace owner and open **Settings -> Developer access (MCP & API)**. Name the connection and choose permissions. Read and Train are default; sending, publishing, and booking need explicit permission.
5. Click **Create connection token** and copy it once. Keep it locally in the `BEAM_TOKEN` environment variable, never in chat or source control. Use the exact endpoint and commands in the [Beam developer access guide](https://beamtexting.com/docs/developer-access?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=voice-agent-prompts&utm_content=beam-developer-access).
6. Ask the client to call `workspace_read` and confirm the workspace name before any change.

OAuth-only hosted connectors, such as the claude.ai web connector, are not supported yet. For technical API integrations, find the API key in Settings and keep it server-side. Users perform signups, logins, and token handling themselves; never paste keys, tokens, or passwords into chat.

Beam supports iMessage on supported devices, with SMS fallback where configured. SMS fallback is subject to carrier A2P requirements. Consent and opt-out rules still apply. Beam is not affiliated with Apple. For further setup, use the [Beam quickstart](https://beamtexting.com/docs/quickstart?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=voice-agent-prompts&utm_content=beam-quickstart).

## Use this prompt library

The library creates and checks text; it does not place calls or send texts. To prepare a prompt locally, follow the [DIY quickstart](QUICKSTART_15_MIN.md) to install the CLI, then render and lint a [niche example](../examples/README.md). Lint checks text heuristically; it does not verify platform configuration or runtime behavior. Bring your reviewed script to the RizzDial team through the booking link above to discuss setup.
